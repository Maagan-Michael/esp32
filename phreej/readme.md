# Phreej
## _A refrigerator with trust issues_
### Designed for Ma'agan Michael

Phreej is a project to turn the "Trust Refrigerator" into a
locked storage that allows purchasing of goods using the
personal budget with an identification chip.

- Minimize loss
- Enhancing to credit cards as an option
- Fully automated

## How does it work?

1. User scans its ID tag using the adjacent reader
2. The system starts a new session for the user and the lock opens
3. Now the user can take the products and scan them using a barcode scanner 
4. Once done, the user should select "Check out"
5. A transaction with all the details will be sent to the billing system

## Tech

Phreej is based on the following technologies:

- [ESP32] - An SoC designed for IoT implementations
- [C++/Rust] - The programming language for the SoC
- [Python] - The UI
- [Magnetic lock] - Specially crafted for bar refrigerator

And of course Phreej itself is open source with a public repository
 on GitHub.
